# Discord Post - Video Chat Application

## 🎥 Just dropped a sick video chat app using Tencent RTC! 

Hey devs! 👋 Just finished building this real-time video chat app and wanted to share it with the community. Built it with **Tencent RTC MCP Server** and the results are pretty impressive! 

### 🔥 **What makes this special:**
- **Ultra-low latency** - Like seriously, <300ms globally 🌍
- **1080p video quality** - Crystal clear calls
- **Actually works on mobile** - Responsive design that doesn't suck 📱
- **Open source** - Full code available for learning/forking

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
```
Frontend: React 17 + TypeScript + Chakra UI
Backend: Supabase (auth + database)
Video Engine: Tencent RTC MCP Server  
Deployment: Vercel (with edge functions)
```

### 🎮 **Wanna try it? Here's how:**

**Step 1:** Hit up the demo → https://video-chat-app-demo-f2fjeydqf-kirajin132580-2360s-projects.vercel.app

**Step 2:** Register with any email (you'll need to verify it)

**Step 3:** Grab your Call User ID (it's like an 8-character code)

**Step 4:** Open incognito/another browser → register as different user

**Step 5:** Exchange IDs and start calling! 📞

### 💻 **For the devs:**
The implementation is actually pretty clean:
- Server-side UserSig generation (more secure than client-side)
- Smart ID conversion system for compatibility
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Proper error boundaries and handling

**GitHub:** https://github.com/KiraJin223/video-chat-app-demo

### 🤔 **Why Tencent RTC?**
Tried a bunch of different solutions but this one hit different:
- 10k free minutes monthly (perfect for indie projects)
- Global CDN that actually works everywhere
- SDK documentation that doesn't make you want to cry
- 99.99% uptime (better than my sleep schedule)

### 🚀 **What's next:**
- Group calls (3-9 people)
- Screen sharing
- Maybe some fun filters/effects
- Mobile app versions

**Questions?** Drop them below! Always happy to chat about WebRTC, React, or just random dev stuff 🤓

Also if anyone wants to contribute or has ideas for features, the repo is open for PRs!
